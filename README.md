#### 📌 Problem Statement
Cricket platforms like Cricbuzz see a sharp drop in user engagement during non-match periods. Younger fans who missed historic moments lack emotional connection, resulting in lower retention.

#### 👀 User Insight

#### 💡 Product Idea: *Legends Archive*
- **Format:** 3–5 min short episodes in a timeline narrative
- **Content:** Mix of motion graphics, interviews, fan reactions, and animated reenactments
