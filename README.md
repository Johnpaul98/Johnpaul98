#### 📌 Problem Statement
Cricket platforms like Cricbuzz see a sharp drop in user engagement during non-match periods. Younger fans who missed historic moments lack emotional connection, resulting in lower retention.

#### 👀 User Insight
> “I wish I could've seen Dhoni winning the 2007 T20 World Cup live… I was too young back then.”

#### 💡 Product Idea: *Legends Archive*
- **Format:** 3–5 min short episodes in a timeline narrative
- **Content:** Mix of motion graphics, interviews, fan reactions, and animated reenactments
- **Pilot Storyline:** "The Dhoni Journey – From Ranchi to 2007 WC Win"
- **Engagement Hook:** Nostalgia + Episodic Viewing → Emotional Retention Loop

#### 🛠️ MVP Design
- Video content using motion graphics + archival interviews
- Personalized recommendations
- Off-season distribution
- Brand sponsorships

#### 📈 Success Metrics
- +20% Avg. Session Time (off-season)
- >60% Completion Rate
- +15% Weekly Retention
